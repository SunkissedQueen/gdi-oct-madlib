## Git hygiene—best practices for maintaining clean and effective version control.

1. **Commit Often**:
   - "Make small commits frequently rather than large ones infrequently. This helps keep track of changes easily."

2. **Use Meaningful Commit Messages**:
   - "Write clear commit messages that describe what changes were made."

3. **Don’t Commit Half-Done Work**:
   - "Only commit code when it’s complete or at a logical stopping point."

4. **Use Branches Effectively**:
   - "Always create new branches for features or fixes instead of committing directly to main."

5. **Pull Before You Push**:
   - "Always pull from the remote repository before pushing your changes."

6. **Delete Merged Branches**:
   - "After merging a feature branch into main, delete it to keep your branch list clean."
